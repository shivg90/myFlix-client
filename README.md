# myFlix

This is the client-side repository that works with the existing [server-side code](https://github.com/shivg90/myflix-app) for the myFlix application.

This application renders the interface used to request and receive responses from the server-side.
I have used the React Library to display several interface views that will handle the data through the (previously defined) REST API endpoints.

Together with the server-side, the **MERN STACK** has been adopted for this project (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js); a full-stack javascript technology.
